== Get it up and running

Firstly just clone this repo. If you wish to try out the demo app corresponding with
a particular episode of the accompanying blog series, checkout the appropriate tag (named after each episode)


=== Backend
. Open a terminal and cd to `$albums/backend`
. (Optional/Depending on your ghc version in path) - `stack setup`
. `stack build`
. `stack exec albums`

If you would like to hack with reload support:
- `stack install halive` alternatively clone https://github.com/lukexi/halive[halive] and build with stack manually (you might need to fiddle to ensure the ghc version used matches/is compatible with the backend app)
- `stack exec halive src/Main.hs src`
- Edit/save and enjoy recompile and auto restart



You may test that it's up and running by `curl http://localhost:8081/artists/1`

. `elm-package install --yes`
